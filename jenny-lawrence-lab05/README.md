**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We are creating a form in order to let a user add to and populate a blog page. This will also render the blog post in the search fields. 

## Getting Started
User must use handlebars in order to create tmeplate for the page. 
User must create a form in HTML in order to be able to create and render a new blog post on the page. 
User must make sure that the functions are used in HTML to connect the HTMl and JS documents.
